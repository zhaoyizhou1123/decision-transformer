# Environment with linear Q
# |A|, Q-functions
# Q-function format: each line, a point of function and slope, derive a linear function (A lines)
# Automatically deduce state space, horizon, transition and reward
# state space = 0,1,2,...,s, where s is the first int such that all Q(s,a)=0
# horizon is s+1
# initial state is always 0

# |A|
2

# Q. point s coordinate, point Q coordinate, slope. Slope should be negative
